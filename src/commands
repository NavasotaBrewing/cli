Devices are configured from the config file at /etc/NavasotaBrewing/rtu_conf.yaml

Commands are run with a device id, not the device name. Some commands affect the controller (like STR1.set_cn). Those commands
can be run from any device configured to that controller.

See all commands relating to the shell with `=> help`. See this page with `=> commands`.
